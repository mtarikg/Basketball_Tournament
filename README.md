Please go over the ***Prompts.txt*** file to check the project requisites, the detailed specification of the project and the main prompts given to the AI tools to generate the website and logos.

### Additional Notes:
ChatGPT preferred to create the whole website step by step. It broke down this process into 6 steps, namely, ***User Name Input Page***, ***Team Selection Page***, 
***Tournament Page***, ***Final Game and Champion Declaration***, ***User Experience*** and ***Responsive Design***.

The imaginative names and logos for the basketball teams were not produced on the first try, even though it was stated in ***Prompt 3***. Another specific prompt was needed to produce the end result.

The first two steps, ***User Name Input Page*** and ***Team Selection Page***, respectively, were created easily by only taking a couple more prompts.

However, starting from the step 3, ***Tournament Page***, confusions started to arise. Showing all stages in the tournament all at one page, not listing the games for a certain stage, 
not revealing the winners of the games, to name a few.
Several attempts to direct ChatGPT to produce a desired outcome resulted in a failure: 
It started to generate predefined match-ups and winners of them with completely different teams than the ones created at first. 

Later, it started to forget the functionality of a button in a way that it enabled to go to the next stage without determining the result of the games of the current one. Fixing this issue came up with another
unexpected effect: It assigned a button for each game on a stage whereas it was supposed to have only one for all games. Additionally, the result of clicking on one button appeared on another one, 
running out of buttons and no possibility of playing the remaining games eventually. At one point, it decided to create 6 buttons, 4 of which assigned to each game, 1 for playing all games at once and
the last one for moving on to the next stage. Furthermore, it was possible to simulate the games again and again, producing duplicate outputs and breaking the tournament format down.

Even though it was successfully sent to the next page, there was no list of games with advancing teams from the previous one. To generate the necessary games, it used a straightforward algorithm
by using if-else clauses for each stage and a separate method to generate the final game.

After all of them, it still needed reminder prompts which then lead to trying to even rewrite everything from the scratch for the following requirements:

-Calling the user by his/her name during the team selection process (first given in ***Prompt 4***, then stated by itself in ***User Experience***)

-Implementing the highlighting functionality of the selected team by the user (given in ***Prompt 4***)

-Considering what to show at the end of the tournament, including the case of which the champion is the user's (first given in ***Prompt 4***, then stated by itself in ***Final Game and Champion Declaration***)

Finally, inserting a footer to the website was simply tackled.

Consequently, the website still have minor yet undesired behavior and some bugs. Successfull implementation of Responsive Design. 
No use of Bootstrap and semantic elements of HTML despite both being stated.
